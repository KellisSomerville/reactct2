PROBLEM #3 

Visit the https://react.dev/learn website and explain the diagram and writeup in the Using Hooks example in detail.  Additionally, answer -  Why are hooks beneficial?  Can Hooks be used in class components?  What other hooks are available other than useState and useEffect? 

My Explanation:

As far as the diagram goes, MyApp is getting it's information from the MyButton component, which inside houses the count feature that makes the functionality possible. A state variable 'count' is initialized at 0 with the useState hook with a function that probably allows it to increment and update the value.

Hooks are beneficial to developers because they simplify code and allow the usage of use state and other features without a class component. Hooks make your code easier to read and understand with organizing logic with individual hooks.

Hooks are designed for using them in functional components and not class components.

Other hooks that are availabe other than useState and useEffect are useRef, useMemo, and useCallback. Those are only some of the built-in hooks that are availabe to use, but there are more out there. You can even get customized hooks for your own usage.
